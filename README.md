## 🧩 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **design, simulation, and implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using both **Proteus schematic design** and **Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado**.  
The goal was to understand how fundamental digital building blocks integrate to form a complex processing component capable of performing a variety of arithmetic and logical operations.

The development process began with the design of essential combinational circuits such as:
- **8-bit Adder** – for binary addition.  
- **8-bit Subtractor** – for performing binary subtraction using two’s complement logic.  
- **8-bit Multiplier** – for binary multiplication using AND-Add logic.  
- **8-bit Comparator** – for comparing two binary numbers.  
- **8-bit Multiplexer** – for selecting one input from multiple data lines.

Each of these modules was created and simulated in **Proteus** to validate their functional accuracy.  
Once verified, the principles from these individual circuits were combined to construct the **8-bit ALU** — a unified digital system capable of handling multiple operations like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logical AND/OR/XOR**, **comparison**, **modulus**, and **bit shifting**.

The Verilog-based ALU design was then implemented in **Xilinx Vivado**, undergoing **synthesis, implementation, and device-level mapping**.  
The resulting **RTL schematic** and **FPGA placement views** confirmed correct logic synthesis and optimal resource allocation on the target device.

## ⚙️ 8-Bit Multiplier Circuit

<img width="1650" height="673" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-20 202255" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77bc392f-5769-46b8-97c8-6cb094f9dc79" />

*Figure: 8-bit multiplier schematic implemented in Proteus.*

This schematic represents an **8-bit binary multiplier** designed using basic logic gates.  
It performs the multiplication of two 8-bit binary numbers using **AND gates for partial product generation** and **adders for summing those partial products**.

### 🔍 Working Principle:
1. Each bit of the multiplicand is ANDed with every bit of the multiplier to form partial products.  
2. The partial products are then shifted according to their bit positions.  
3. A series of **full adders and half adders** combine these partial products to produce the final 16-bit output.  
4. The output represents the product of two unsigned 8-bit binary numbers.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- Fully combinational logic design (no clock or sequential logic).  
- Optimized for gate-level understanding and hardware implementation.  
- Verified through simulation in Proteus to ensure correct binary multiplication.

Although the array multiplier functions correctly, it is not suitable for inclusion inside a single-cycle ALU.
Array multipliers have a very long combinational delay, and placing them inside the ALU would dramatically increase the ALU’s critical path. This reduces the maximum operating frequency of the entire processor.
For this reason, real CPU designs implement multiplication in a separate hardware unit—often multi-cycle or pipelined—while keeping the ALU optimized for fast operations like addition, subtraction, logic, and shifts.




## ⚙️ 8-Bit Adder Circuit

<img width="440" height="509" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-02 031753" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae52c913-2960-49e5-9081-81b75fe8568c" />


*Figure: 8-bit adder schematic implemented in Proteus.*

This schematic represents an **8-bit binary adder** designed using **full adders** and **logic gates**.  
It performs the arithmetic addition of two 8-bit binary numbers, generating an 8-bit sum and a carry output.

### 🔍 Working Principle:
1. Each pair of corresponding bits from the two inputs is added using a **full adder circuit**.  
2. The **carry output** from each stage is propagated to the next higher bit.  
3. The final carry output represents the overflow (if any) of the addition process.  
4. The resulting 8-bit output is displayed as the sum of the two binary inputs.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- Fully combinational logic — no clock signal required.  
- Designed using **cascaded full adders** for accurate carry propagation.  
- Verified through Proteus simulation to ensure correct arithmetic behavior.  
- Can be used as a building block for larger arithmetic circuits like **adders/subtractors** or **ALUs**.

*Figure: 8-bit subtractor schematic implemented in Proteus.*

This schematic represents an **8-bit binary subtractor** built using **full adders** and **logic gates**.  
It performs subtraction between two 8-bit binary numbers using the **2’s complement method**, which allows subtraction to be achieved using addition logic.

### 🔍 Working Principle:
1. The second operand (subtrahend) is converted into its **2’s complement** form using inverters and an initial carry input of `1`.  
2. The resulting complemented value is **added** to the first operand (minuend) using a series of full adders.  
3. The final sum represents the subtraction result, while the carry output can indicate **overflow** or **borrow**.  
4. This configuration allows both **positive and negative results** to be represented correctly in binary.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- Implemented entirely using combinational logic (no clock needed).  
- Uses **full adder blocks** with inverted inputs to achieve subtraction.  
- Supports both signed and unsigned 8-bit binary subtraction.  
- Verified through Proteus simulation to confirm accurate bitwise operation.  
- Can serve as a foundation for designing **ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units)** or **arithmetic processors**.



## ⚙️ 8-Bit Comparator Circuit

<img width="1167" height="730" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-04 145433" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca4de749-781b-45fc-a54e-51500e84baf1" />

*Figure: 8-bit comparator schematic implemented in Proteus.*

This schematic represents an **8-bit magnitude comparator** built using **logic gates**.  
The circuit compares two 8-bit binary numbers and produces three outputs indicating whether one number is **greater than**, **less than**, or **equal to** the other.

### 🔍 Working Principle:
1. Each bit of the two 8-bit inputs is compared starting from the most significant bit (MSB) down to the least significant bit (LSB).  
2. Logic gates are used to determine three possible conditions:  
   - **A > B**  
   - **A = B**  
   - **A < B**  
3. The comparison is performed hierarchically — if higher-order bits differ, lower bits are ignored.  
4. The final output consists of three indicator signals showing the relationship between the two binary inputs.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- Fully combinational design using logic gates (no clock required).  
- Compares two 8-bit unsigned binary values simultaneously.  
- Produces three distinct outputs: **Greater**, **Equal**, and **Less**.  
- Verified through Proteus simulation for correct logical operation.  
- Useful as a core block in **ALUs**, **sorting units**, and **digital decision systems**.



## ⚙️ 8-Bit Multiplexer Circuit

<img width="730" height="435" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-06 224526" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6d8fafd-a23a-477c-adb9-d94229bbe42e" />

*Figure: 8-bit multiplexer schematic implemented in Proteus.*

This schematic represents an **8-bit 8:1 Multiplexer (MUX)** designed using **AND, OR, and NOT gates**.  
The circuit selects one of the eight input data lines and forwards it to a single output line based on the selection inputs.

### 🔍 Working Principle:
1. The multiplexer has **8 input lines (D0–D7)**, **3 selection lines (S0–S2)**, and **one output (Y)**.  
2. Depending on the binary combination of the selection lines, one of the eight inputs is routed to the output.  
3. The **NOT gates** generate the complement of the selection lines, ensuring all possible selection combinations are handled.  
4. **AND gates** enable the input corresponding to the selected address line, while the **OR gate** combines these outputs into a single line.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- Implements an **8:1 selection mechanism** using basic logic gates.  
- Fully combinational design with no clock or sequential logic.  
- Verified through Proteus simulation for correct selection of inputs.  
- Useful in data routing, control systems, and digital signal selection.  
- Can be extended to larger multiplexers (e.g., 16:1 or 32:1) by cascading multiple 8:1 units.

*Figure: RTL schematic of 8-bit ALU generated in Vivado.*

This schematic represents the **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** designed and synthesized in **Verilog HDL** using **Xilinx Vivado**.  
The ALU performs a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations and produces corresponding status flags such as **zero**, **negative**, **carry**, and **overflow**.



### 🔍 Working Principle:
1. The ALU takes two 8-bit inputs `A` and `B` and a 4-bit select signal `S` to determine the operation to be executed.
